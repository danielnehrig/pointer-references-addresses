# Memory managment

## High Level vs Low Level

Low level = System near Languages Compiled Binaries
High Level = Interpreter based languages abstraction ontop of Low Level Languages Interpreted code transformed to byte code

## Addresses

when you declare a variable or any kind of data type  
those have to be saved to memory and the reference id of those in memory are called addresses/address

```typescript
const value: number = 5;
// example
// 0x7ffee43c608c - hex address in memory which holds the value 5 this represents the variable value declared and initialized above.
```
